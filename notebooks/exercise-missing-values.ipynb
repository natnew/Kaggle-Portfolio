If you need a reminder of how to do this, please use the instructions below._)  \n\nFirst, you'll need to join the competition if you haven't already.  So open a new window by clicking on [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-data-for-ml-course).  Then click on the **Join Competition** button.\n\n![join competition image](https://i.imgur.com/wLmFtH3.png)\n\nNext, follow the instructions below:\n- Begin by clicking on the blue **COMMIT** button in the top right corner.  This will generate a pop-up window.  \n- After your code has finished running, click on the blue **Open Version** button in the top right of the pop-up window.  This brings you into view mode of the same page. You will need to scroll down to get back to these instructions.\n- Click on the **Output** tab on the left of the screen.  Then, click on the **Submit to Competition** button to submit your results to the leaderboard.\n- If you want to keep working to improve your performance, select the blue **Edit** button in the top right of the screen. Then you can change your model and repeat the process.\n\n# Keep going\n\nMove on to learn what **[categorical variables](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/categorical-variables)** are, along with how to incorporate them into your machine learning models.  Categorical variables are very common in real-world data, but you'll get an error if you try to plug them into your models without processing them first!","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n**[Intermediate Machine Learning Home Page](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intermediate-machine-learning)**\n\n\n\n\n\n*Have questions or comments?
